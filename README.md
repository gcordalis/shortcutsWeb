A web based Shortcuts creator.

Built with Vue.js and Vuetify.

A live version is available at [shortcutsweb.app](https://shortcutsweb.app) however you're welcome to set up and configure your own instance.

## Shortcuts-JS
Shortcuts Web utilises the amazing work by [Josh Farrant](https://github.com/joshfarrant) and the other contributers working on [Shortcuts-JS](https://github.com/joshfarrant/shortcuts-js).

If the action you want isn't available please check out the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/joshfarrant/shortcuts-js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for Shortcuts-JS. I strive to update Shortcuts Web with new actions as soon as they're available.
